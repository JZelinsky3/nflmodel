Week
Just the NFL week number (1 through 18). Tells you which slate the game belongs to.

Kickoff
Date and time of the game. Usually UTC or local EST. Useful for sorting, or knowing which games are still upcoming.

Matchup
The two teams (away @ home). Example: “CAR @ NE”.

Pick
This is your model’s recommendation. If your model probability for CAR > market probability, then Pick = CAR. It highlights which side has value.

Edge
The difference between your model’s win probability and the market’s implied probability.
Example: model 60% vs market 40% → Edge = +20%.
This is the “betting edge” you’re chasing.

Model%
Your model’s estimated win probability for the picked team. After adjusting for features like rest days, form, etc.

Mkt%
The market’s implied win probability, derived from the moneyline (or spread). It’s your baseline prior.

Fair ML
The “fair” moneyline price based on your model probability.
Formula:

For a favorite: -100 * (p / (1 - p))

For a dog: +100 * ((1 - p) / p)
Lets you see whether the sportsbook line is too high or low relative to your model.

Home Spr
The market spread for the home team (negative = favored). Example: -3.5 means the home team is favored by 3.5 points.
